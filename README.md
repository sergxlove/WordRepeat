## About 

The program for repeating English words on WPF is a smart simulator based on the scientific method of interval repetition. The app offers several training modes: flashcards, compliance tests, listening, and written input, automatically adapting the difficulty and repetition schedule based on user responses. The algorithm analyzes which words are more difficult to come up with and plans to show them more often to ensure reliable memorization.

The central module makes it easy to manage your personal database of words: add new ones with translations, examples, and tags, import lists, and organize vocabulary by topic. The entire training history and progress are tracked in detail: the program builds visual graphs of vocabulary growth, shows statistics of correct answers and saves a report on each training session, helping the user to focus on problem areas and see their constant progress.
